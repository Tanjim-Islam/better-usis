### Project Overview
BRAC University USIS, or "University Student Information System," is the online platform utilized by BRAC University for managing various student-related aspects, encompassing admissions, registration, academic records, and course selection. As a student or prospective applicant at BRAC University, you are likely to engage with USIS for various tasks throughout your academic journey. In an effort to contribute to my university and assist my juniors, I created a frontend interface for USIS as a personal project. This initiative involves modernizing the UI and implementing new features on top of the existing ones.

This project is not affiliated with BRAC University. It is a personal endeavor undertaken to give back to my university and support my fellow students. Please read the [Terms of Service](TOS.md).
